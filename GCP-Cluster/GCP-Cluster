create project -> right top -> give name cloudera
select that project.
try compute engines -> 4 instances
names node1,node2,node3,node4
(all instances communicate by ssh)

you can go with instance groups or vm instances
here u can make all at once or one by one.

in the name node1, use any data center, 
you cannot select more than 8 cpu cores from a single data center
4cpus and 26gb
boot disk is ubuntu 14.04 (because cloudera is available only on this)
ssd persistent disk of 100 gb


fire wall

allow http traffic
httos trafic and allow api access to all google cloud services in the same project.

create
=====================================
similary create node2,node3,node4 from "different data centers".

=================================
Now   each macnine has to work with each other in passwordless ssh.

i need to makesure each node is communicating with each other.


API Manager -> do it on ubuntu not in windows.
better to do it from linux.

make API key from API manager..

Credentials -> create credentials -> service account key ->new service account -> give any name -> trainer name is hasti so gave it..
