create project -> right top -> give name cloudera
select that project.
try compute engines -> 4 instances
names node1,node2,node3,node4
(all instances communicate by ssh)

you can go with instance groups or vm instances
here u can make all at once or one by one.

in the name node1, use any data center, 
you cannot select more than 8 cpu cores from a single data center
4cpus and 26gb
boot disk is ubuntu 14.04 (because cloudera is available only on this)
ssd persistent disk of 100 gb


fire wall

allow http traffic
httos trafic and allow api access to all google cloud services in the same project.

create
=====================================
similary create node2,node3,node4 from "different data centers".

=================================
Now   each macnine has to work with each other in passwordless ssh.

i need to makesure each node is communicating with each other.


API Manager -> do it on ubuntu not in windows.
better to do it from linux.

make API key from API manager..

Credentials -> create credentials -> service account key ->new service account -> give any name -> trainer name is hasti so gave it..
select key type as P12 -> create -> this creates private key. 
Make sure you save this key. 
dont forget to save the private key password -> here t got printed as "notasecret".

very imp -> by default it is notasecret .

Now we made credentials available and apis are ready.
====================================================
home -> compute engines -> nodes are ready.
node1 master and all other slaves.
click on connect & open 4 windows.

password less authentication:::

first switch to root user -> sudo -i
root@node1: 
change password
passwd  -> hasti any password.

we created password now. 
similarly login every node and password must be same in all.



sudo -i
passwd
========================================
now ssh password free 

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
need to update 4 things

permitrootlogin change from without password to yes
PermitRootLogin yes

remove the comment for #AuthorizedKeysFile     %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
change the %h to /root/ as the .ssh folder is used from root user.

ChallengeResponseAuthentication no change it to yes.

#PasswordAuthentication yes    this should be yes and uncommented.

the above are the 4 changes.

now we changed configuration of this. so we need to restart services
service ssh restart
you should get ssh stop/waiting
ssh start/running.. if it is not coming, restart VM instance.

time 19:35
after that generate keygen
ssh-keygen

restart service again

do the same thing for all other nodes.
=======================================================
Now open all the four windows again.. from google home page, 
This is to just restart ssh only
=====================================

THis is the basic setup..

ssh-copy-id root@node2
this will ask for node 2, we have set hasti.. so give that
now check ssh root@node2 .. should not ask for password for the second time

ssh-copy-id root@node3
ssh-copy-id root@node4
============================
same thing do it in node2,3,4
if we are in 2
ssh-copy-id root@node1
ssh-copy-id root@node3
ssh-copy-id root@node4
==================================

Now you can setup any distribution::
with the help of scripting we can do all.

we need to set a variable for any hadoop system

sysctl -w vm.swappiness=0
on each machine 
===========================

===================================
