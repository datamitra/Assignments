1) They started with tell me about ur profile. 					                                                                                      2) Draw the latest project outline and explain. 										
3) From our explanation, they start with questioning. 				
4) He asked me about which data ingestion tools u used. I said SQOOP. 		
5) Then he asked how u using incremental load in importing data in SQOOP. 	
6) From which database u are importing data. 
7) How many data daily u are getting. 						
8) How many node clusters u have.						 
9) From how many years previous data is there. 				
10) What is the per node configuration in ur cluster? 				

11) Which Spark version u are using. 						
12) Which distribustion u are using with version. 				
13) What is the difference between RDD and Dataframe? 				
14) RDD operations. 								
15) Write some preprocessing steps in Spark. 					
16) How to convert RDD into Dataframe. 						
17) Write some Dataframe operations. 						
18) Write some complex Dataframe operations. 					
19) After writing those operations he is asking who told u to implement these in ur team. 									
20) How many members in ur team. 						
21) Is there Devop engineer in ur team. 					
22) He asked how we apply Hive UDF in Spark. 					
23) Dataframe is very Hot topic in my interview.(I think he worked more on SparkSQL).									 
24) Which Flume Source type you used in ur project. 				
25) Explain Flume flow.(Actually he has very great knowledge on Flume). 	
26) How to create partition table. 						
27) How to load data in Hive Dynamically. 					
28) Then its time of Performance Tuning, He asked me how u did performance tuning in ur project. (In Spark project, i.e  how to set executor-memory options in spark-submit) 							
29) Difference between Parquate and Avro file format. 				
30) How we will use in Hive.							 
31) Write any scala code u written in ur project.

1)what is fair schedular

 Fair scheduling is a method of assigning resources to jobs such that all jobs get, on average, an equal share of resources over time. When there is a single job running, that job uses the entire cluster. ... The fair scheduler organizes jobs into pools, and divides resources fairly between these pools.

2)what is serde

SerDe is short for Serializer/Deserializer. Hive uses the SerDe interface for IO. ... A SerDe allows Hive to read in data from a table, and write it back out to HDFS in any custom format. Anyone can write their own SerDe for their own data formats.

3)about parquet

Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model or programming language.
