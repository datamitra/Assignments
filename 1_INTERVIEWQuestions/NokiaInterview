1st Round :

-> how can we check disk usage.
-> how can we change the permission of file from read to write
-> how can we start the cluster in safe mode
-> what is advantage of Mapr over HDFS
-> how to check physical memory 

2nd Round :

-> what happen when we type command like cd, pwd 
-> If some java program got stuck or hanged , then what we will do
-> difference between external and managed
-> about BG process
-> if we run any process at bg then how its processing is going on ( we can check it by it's process ID)
-> If we change the schema of external and managed table.
-> Garbage collector in Java
-> Where the output of mappers to be written ? Why not in HDFS ?
-> Replication can more than 3 in HDFS
