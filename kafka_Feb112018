---------------------
Get the data where it is created to where it can be analyzed
Because Enterprise is powered by data

Spend less effort in moving the data around

One such pattern is: Publish Subscribe -> Pub/Sub
Sender (publisher) sends a piece of data(Message) not specifically directeing to a receiver, instead publisher just classifies messages(Topic).

Receiver (subscriber) will fetch messages from Topic.

pub/sub system will have a broker (central point) where messages are published and stored.

Direct connections vs PubSub System
